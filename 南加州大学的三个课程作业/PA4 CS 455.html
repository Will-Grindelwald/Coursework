CS 455 Programming Assignment 4</h2></center>

<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction and Background</h3></a>

In this assignment you will be using data
structures and algorithms we have covered recently to 
write a program that has some interesting, and maybe even entertaining, output.
Also, the design will be less
constrained than in past assignments: you will have the
opportunity to decide on the exact interface and representation for
your classes.  
You'll also get some practice with command-line
arguments and text file processing.

<p>
In this assignment you will have a chance to use one of the more
powerful Java tools we have seen, Maps.  
You'll also be using command-line arguments and file processing.
</p><p>

The program we'll create here will write an essay automatically!  Or put
less grandly, it will generate random text.  To make the result sound
more like real English, than, say just choosing random words from the
dictionary, we're going to use some sample text to give us information
about likely words and word sequences.
</p><p>

We'll call the sample text document we're using the <em>source
text</em>.  Consider generating text using the frequencies of
occurrences of words in the source text to choose the next word to
generate in our random text.  E.g., if "the" occurs with probability
0.03 in the source text, then we will generate it with that
probability.  This could be done easily by every time just choosing a
word at random from the source text. We call random text generated
this way order-0 text.  We could get something that sounds a little
more like English by taking into account <em>sequences</em> of words from the
source text.  For order-1 text, once we generate a word, <em>w</em>, we generate
the next word based on its probability of following <em>w</em> in the
source text.  </p><p>

Here is an example of some order-1 text that uses <em>My Man
Jeeves</em> by P.G. Wodehouse as the source text:

</p><blockquote style="color:blue">
"Unsuitable for me to what the ear of omniscience. As a 
topping place is a wealthy bird, so mixed up by the "Lincolnshire." I looked 
fine in a grey check suit, and so forth. Brainy coves. Corky when I decided that 
one of difficult for the Park, and settled down Washington Square--artists and 
I'm a lot first. This makes it wasn't long cosy chats about clothes is what the 
game. 
</blockquote>

This passage sounds somewhat nonsensical.
<p>

We could generalize this, using order-k word sequences, which
we'll call prefixes here.  Every k-word prefix we generate is
a sequence found in the source text.  We generate the next word
by looking at the frequency of all of the successors of this prefix in
the source text.
</p><p>
Here is an example of order-2 text from the same source:

</p><blockquote style="color:blue">
I'm a bit instead of going back and having 
long cosy chats about the thing with aunt. So I sent Jeeves out to find a decent 
apartment, and settled down for a bit of exile. I'm bound to say that New York's 
a topping place to be called _More American Birds_. When he has put the cat out 
and locked up the office for the 'Lincolnshire.'" He shook his head. "I'd rather 
not, sir." "But it's the straight goods. I'm going to make a hit. Meanwhile, by 
using the utmost tact and persuasiveness, he was going to put my shirt on him." 
</blockquote>


We see that the order-2 text is more grammatical, although a bit off from what a person would write.
<p>

We'll go through a detailed example of generating words this way

</li></ul>

<a name="assgt"><h3>The assignment</h3>
</a>

You will be implementing a program which uses a word-level Markov
chain to generate random text, using data from a sample text document,
as described in the 
the <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#intro">introduction</a>, above, and described in more detail in
the next <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#markov">section</a>.  
For order-k text, here we're going
to call "k" the <em>prefixLength</em>, and the previous k words
generated we'll call the current <em>prefix</em>.
<p>
A run of your program, 

</p><pre> java GenText <em>[</em>-d<em>]</em> <em>prefixLength numWords sourceFile outFile</em> </pre> 

generates
<em>numWords</em> words of <em>prefixLength</em>-order text using
<em>sourceFile</em> as the source document.  The generated words are
written to <em>outFile</em> (not the console).  The square brackets
([]) above denote optional arguments to your program (the square
brackets themselves are not part of the command line).  You have one
optional argument here, "-d", the presence of which means the program
will be run in debugging mode; we'll describe what that means in the
section on <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#debug">debugging mode</a>.
<p>

For our purposes, we don't have to treat punctuation or other
characters specially: any sequence of non-whitespace characters is
considered a word.  So, for example, the words "Dog", "dog", "dog.",
and "dog!" are considered distinct, and the frequency that each occurs
in the source file, and which words generally follow each of them may
be different.
</p><p>

The format of outFile is as follows: there will be one space
between each word generated, with up to 80 characters generated per
line (the last character on a line should not be a space).  All lines
of output should contain as many words as possible to be full, but not
more than 80 characters, except the last line.  I.e., the text will be
flush left, ragged right, with a maximum line-length of 80 characers.
Note that you are not required to produce justified text (i.e., the
output for each line doesn't have to be exactly 80 characters).  Also,
you do not have to break up words by syllable over multiple lines.

</p><p>
Here is an example of this kind of of formatting. Just for the example we'll
assume a max of 30 characters per line, to make it easy to count
characters.  The text sample used is a sentence from this document.  The first line in italics below indicates the column
number of the characters below it:

</p><pre><em>
123456789012345678901234567890
</em>
For our purposes, we don't
have to treat punctuation or
other characters specially:
any sequence of non-whitespace
characters is considered a
word.
</pre>

<p>
Additional program requirements are described in the following
sections and summarized here:
</p><ul>

  <li> <strong>Efficiency.</strong> you will get more credit if you have an efficient solution.  A few
  approaches and their complexities are discussed in the <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#approach">approach</a>
  section.

  </li><li>  <strong>Class design.</strong> you are required to design and implement the classes discussed
  in the section on <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#design">class design</a>.  We will also be evaluating the quality of the fleshed out version of this design.

  </li><li> <strong>Error checking.</strong> you are required to do the error checking spelled out in the
  section on <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#error">that</a>.

  </li><li> <strong>README.</strong> as usual, you are required to submit a <kbd>README</kbd> file.
  See the  <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#submit">end of this document</a> for what needs
  to go in it for this assignment.

  </li><li> <strong>Style / Documentation / Design.</strong> 
 Also as usual, your program will be evaluated on style and documentation.  See the section on <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#style">grading criteria</a> for more details.
</li></ul>
<p>

<a name="markov"></a></p><h3><a name="markov">Word-level Markov text generation</a></h3><a name="markov">

<p> For generating text, you should initially choose
<tt>prefixLength</tt> consecutive words at random from the sample text
and use them as the initial prefix (we'll call this a random prefix)
in the random writing process outlined earlier.  (The program does not
generate the words in this initial prefix.)  Your program should then
write <tt>numWords</tt> words to <tt>outFile</tt>.  Each of these
words should be chosen based on the current prefix.  (Each time a word
<em>w</em> is written to <tt>outFile</tt>, the prefix is updated by
removing its first word and appending <em>w</em> to the end.)

</p><p> 

For example, suppose that <kbd>prefixLength</kbd> = <em>2</em> and the sample
file contains


</p><blockquote style="color:blue">
I like the big blue dog better than the big elephant with the big blue
hat on his tusk.  
</blockquote>

Here is how the first three words might be chosen:

<ul>

<li> A two-word sequence is chosen at random to become the initial
prefix.  Let's suppose that "the big" is chosen.

<p>

</p></li><li> The first word must be chosen based on the probability that
it follows the prefix (currently "the big") in the source.  The source
contains three occurrences of "the big".  Two times it is followed by "blue",
and once it is followed by "elephant".  Thus, the
next word must be chosen so that there is a 2/3 chance that "blue"
will be chosen, and a 1/3 chance that "elephant" will be chosen.
 Let's suppose that we choose "blue"
this time.

<p>

</p></li><li> The next word must be chosen based on the probability that it
follows the prefix (currently "big blue") in the source.  The source
contains two occurrences of "big blue".  Once it is followed by "dog",
and the other time it is followed by "hat".  Thus, the next word must
be chosen so that there is a 50-50 probability of choosing "dog"
vs. "hat".  Let's suppose that we choose "hat" this time.

<p>

</p></li><li> The next word must be chosen based on the probability that
it follows the prefix (currently "blue hat") in the source.  The source
contains only one occurrence of "blue hat", and it is followed by "on".
Thus, the next word must be "on" (100% probability).

<p>
</p></li><li> Thus, the first three words in the output text would be "blue hat on".

</li></ul>

<p>
Note that the words in the initial prefix are not part of the generated text.
</p><p>

If your function ever gets into a situation in which there are no
words to choose from (which can happen if the only occurrence of the
current prefix is at the exact end of the sample), your program should
pick a new random prefix (i.e., the same way it chose the initial
prefix) and continue.  As with the initial prefix, you do not generate
the words in this random prefix.  (This is so we can control the exact
number of words to be generated.)
</p></a><p><a name="markov">

So you don't fail on the very first try (or get into an infinite loop
because you keep choosing a random prefix at the end of the file) you
should choose your random prefix so that you know there is at least
one suffix following it (i.e., so the last word in the prefix is not
the last word in the file).  In fact, to make generating text doable
at all, one user requirement is that the number of words in the source
file is at least one more than <kbd>prefixLength</kbd> (see section on
</a><a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#error">error checking</a> for more details). 
</p><p>

For generating random numbers, use the Java <kbd>Random</kbd> class.  Because of
previous confusion about this class, we'll remind you again here, you should
only create one instance of this object, and then after that use the
same object to generate all random numbers needed.  </p><p> You do not
have to handle a prefixLength of 0 (i.e., order-0 text generation).
This is another one of the input <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#error">errors</a> you'll be
checking for.

</p><p>

<a name="approach"></a></p><h3><a name="approach">Approach</a></h3><a name="approach">

There is a simple way to attack this problem. Create an ArrayList of
strings that contains all of the words from the sample file. To choose
the next word, find each occurrence of the prefix in the sample and
store the word that follows that occurrence into another ArrayList of strings
(let's call it the successors). When you have found all occurrences,
choose a word at random from the successors array.  You will then
shift this word into the prefix so that the prefix now contains the
last <kbd>prefixLength</kbd> words generated.  <p>

If the length (in number of words) of the sample text is <em>s</em>
and the length of the text to generate is <em>g</em>, the above approach
takes time O(<em>s</em> * <em>g</em>).  (To simplify the analysis, we're
considering the length of a prefix as a constant.)  If instead you use
a HashMap to make this search more efficient, you can reduce this to
O(<em>s</em> + <em>g</em>).  This involves preprocessing the source
text to create the map before you start generating words.  </p><p>

Hint about using a HashMap: remember that to use a class as the
KeyType in a HashMap it must implement <kbd>equals</kbd> and
<kbd>hashCode</kbd>.
</p></a><p><a name="approach">

You may choose between these two approaches, or others you may devise
using data structures and algorithms we have covered in class.  More
credit will be given for a more efficient solution.  By efficient, we
mean in big-O terms above; we will not be timing your programs.  You
need to document your approach in your README file.


</a><a name="design"></a></p><h3><a name="design">Class design</a></h3><a name="design">

Unlike the previous programs in this course, this time you are going
to design your own classes, with some guidance.  Subsequently, part of
your style score will be based on the quality of your design.
<p>
When doing an object-oriented design, you first come up with a
candidate set of classes, choosing a name for each, and identifying
the responsibilities of each in the context of the larger program
overall.  We have done that step for you here.  We are requiring you
to have at least the following three classes in your solution, with
the responsibilities described.  You are allowed to add more classes
to your design as you see fit.  The three are:

</p></a><dl><a name="design">
  <dt> <kbd>GenText</kbd> </dt><dd> This contains the <kbd>main</kbd>
    method.  This class will have a main that's responsible for
    processing the command-line arguments, opening and closing the
    files, and handling any errors related to the above tasks.  All
    the other functionality will be delegated to other object(s)
    created in <kbd>main</kbd> and their methods.
<p>
  </p></dd><dt> <kbd>Prefix</kbd> </dt></a><dd><a name="design"> This corresponds to the idea of a prefix
    in the problem description.  That is, a sequence of words that you
    are using as a basis to choose the next word to generate.  Usually
    this sequence consists of the <kbd>prefixLength</kbd> previous
    words you have just generated (except for when you need to get a
    new initial prefix -- there was more about that in the section on
    </a><a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#markov">markov text generation</a>).  When deciding on
    the Prefix methods, you should think in terms of what are the
    things we have to do with a prefix in this program.  (Hint: you
    can look for verbs that are associated with the word "prefix" in the
    problem description.)
<p>
   </p></dd><dt> <kbd>RandomTextGenerator</kbd>
     </dt><dd> This will contain most of the program logic and data structures, and will
     probably only have a few methods.  You will
     create it with some form of the source text and possibly other
     arguments.  Then it will have another method to generate random text
     from that source.

</dd></dl>

Although you haven't done much class design yourself, you have seen
many examples of well-designed classes in the textbook, lecture, labs,
and assignments in this class.  We recommend you review the following
sections of the textbook that give hints on deciding what classes and
methods would make sense for a program design, before you start on
your own design: 8.1, 8.2, 12.1, 12.2 (the last two of these were not
in the original readings).
<p>

One thing to keep in mind is you want the code that operates on some
data to be in the same class that contains that data.  One sign that
your design doesn't have that feature is if your classes tend to have
a lot of <kbd>get</kbd> and <kbd>set</kbd> methods and not much else.
That would indicate that all the code operating on this data is
outside of the class itself.
</p><p>

For example, suppose you decide to use an ArrayList representation
inside your <kbd>Prefix</kbd> class.  If you provide <kbd>Prefix</kbd>
methods such as <kbd>get(i)</kbd> and <kbd>set(i, newvalue)</kbd>,
that's pretty close to the ArrayList interface, so your new class
isn't providing much added value over an ArrayList itself.  You
probably should think instead about operations that deal with the
whole prefix, and how we need to access or manipulate it here.  Note:
your prefix class won't necessarily have an ArrayList in it -- you get
to choose the representation to use.
</p><p>

Hopefully we've made clear the importance of making all instance
variables private.  But even if you make your data private there are
other ways to expose the implementation of your objects.  For example,
if you have a class that contains an ArrayList, and also provide an
accessor method for this ArrayList, it gives clients the ability to change
the contents of that arraylist from outside of the object methods,
possibly invalidating the object.  (We discussed these types of issues
in the lecture discussion of side effects in week 7.)
</p><p>

One more piece of advice about the Prefix class: we
recommend you make it an immutable class.  This can help you avoid
errors related to your mistakenly changing a prefix that has multiple references
to it.  So, if you have
a <kbd>shiftIn</kbd> method, it would return a new Prefix, rather than
updating "<kbd>this</kbd>" (analogous to <kbd>String</kbd>'s
<kbd>substring</kbd> method).
</p><p>

You are welcome to (but not required to) organize your code into
additional classes designed and implemented by you.  Some other
possible classes you might create: an exception class, if one of the
existing ones don't do the job, and/or a separate class to deal with
the formatting of the output.  If you add classes, don't forget to
submit the additional .java files.  See the section on <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#submit">submitting your program</a> for more about changing the
submit command that's in the Makefile.
</p><p>

<a name="debug"></a></p><h3><a name="debug">Debugging mode</a></h3><a name="debug"> 

To help you (and us) in figuring out if your program is doing the
right thing as you develop it, and to help you diagnose bugs, we're
requiring you to produce some debugging output, controlled by
the "-d" command-line argument.
<p>

When debugging is turned on, you'll do two things differently:
</p><ul>

<li> You'll use the fixed seed, 1, for the random number generator, so
the output will be predictable from one debug run to the next.   When the
debug flag is off, you should not use a fixed seed.
<p>
  
</p></li><li> You'll print some debugging output to <kbd>System.out</kbd>.
Each line of debugging output will start with the string "DEBUG:".
When debugging is off, no output goes to the console.
</li></ul>

<strong>More about <kbd>Random</kbd> and the seed.</strong> The random
number sequence generated by a <kbd>Random</kbd> object normally
depends on a seed, which is set in its constructor.  The default
constructor uses a different seed for every <kbd>Random</kbd> object
you create (usually a function of the system clock), but the
one-argument constructor lets the programmer set the seed.  See the
Java documentation for <kbd>Random</kbd> for more details.
<p>

<strong>Details of the required debugging output.</strong>
When debugging is on, every time you generate a new word, you must print out the current
prefix value, the current list of successors, and the word chosen from
that list.  If your program is
at a point where it had to find a new random starting point (i.e., because it
got to the end), it should print out a message to that effect, and the
new prefix to be used.  (This situation is shown as part of the example below.)
</p></a><p><a name="debug">

Here is an example showing part of the debugging output running on the
source <kbd>bluedog</kbd>, whose contents were shown earlier in the
section on </a><a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#markov">markov text generation</a>.
In the example below the % is standing in for the Unix
prompt.  Note: these aren't necessarily the results you will get with
a Random object with a fixed seed of 1.

</p><pre>% <em>java GenText -d 2 20 bluedog bluedog.out</em>
DEBUG: chose a new initial prefix: the big
DEBUG: prefix: the big
DEBUG: successors: blue elephant blue
DEBUG: word generated: blue
DEBUG: prefix: big blue
DEBUG: successors: dog hat
DEBUG: word generated: dog
. . .
DEBUG: prefix: his tusk.
DEBUG: successors: &lt;END OF FILE&gt;
DEBUG: chose a new initial prefix: hat on
DEBUG: prefix: hat on
DEBUG: successors: his 
DEBUG: word generated: his
. . .
</pre>
You do not have to display prefixes in exactly the format shown here.  E.g., you
may print Prefix objects using the usual <kbd>toString</kbd> format,
as long as all the Strings involved at every step are shown in the
output.  However, different words and word sequences printed must be
labeled as above so we (and you) can easily understand the output.
<p>

When debugging is on, all the regular output gets produced as usual
(e.g., to <kbd>bluedog.out</kbd> in this example, which would contain
"blue dog . . . his . . ." along with other output).
</p><p>

<a name="error"></a></p><h3><a name="error">Error checking</a></h3><a name="error">

You will need to report and handle the following user errors.  For
each of the errors, once the error is reported the program should exit
without generating any text.

<ul>
  <li> prefixLength or numWords arguments are not integers

  </li><li> numWords &lt; 0
  </li><li> prefixLength &lt; 1

For the first four listed here, you should also print out a summary of
how to run the program before exiting.  It should look like the java
command we showed near the beginning of the section called </a><a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#assgt">The Assignment</a>.  <p>


<a name="data"></a></p><h3><a name="data">Data files</a></h3><a name="data">
</a><p><a name="data">
If you followed the directions in the section on
</a><a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#files">Assignment Files</a> your assignment directory should
contain copies of some sample data files small and large.

Only
once you
have convinced yourself the program is working correctly by testing it on
small data files with debugging turned on and checking the results,
you should then try it out using
of the larger sources (with debugging turned off), generating a
long text sequence.
</p><p>

For additional real writing
samples to use with this program see <a href="http://gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>, which maintains a
huge library of public domain books.  If your program generates
something that is particularly amusing, please send it to me so I can
share it with the class.  Be sure to identify the sample text and the
prefixLength.

<a name="style"></a></p><h3><a name="style">Grading criteria</a></h3><a name="style">

This program will be graded approximately 70% on correctness, 30% on
design, style, and documentation.  As usual we will be using the </a><a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/style.html">style guidelines</a> published for the class.
There was more about design issues in the section on <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#design">class design</a>.
<p>

<a name="submit"></a></p><h3><a name="submit">README file / Submitting your program</a></h3><a name="submit">
</a><p><a name="submit">
Your <kbd>README</kbd> file must document known bugs in your program,
contain the signed </a><a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#certification">certification</a> shown
near the top of this document, and contain any special instructions or
information for the grader.
</p><p>

In addtion, for this assignment, the README must also document the
approach you took to solving the problem (i.e., description of the
data structures and algorithms involved).  This was discussed in the
section on <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/pa4.html#approach">approach</a>.  You will also include
there information about how your class design relates to this
approach, including what data structures and algorithms are
encapsulated in which of your classes.
</p><p>

The <kbd>submit</kbd> rule in the <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa4/Makefile"><kbd>Makefile</kbd></a> shows what files you need to
submit.  If you add any additional files (e.g., because you add
additional classes), you'll need to add them to the submit rule.
</p><p>
</p><p>
Use the following command to submit your program:

</p><pre>gmake submit
</pre>
<p>
This requires the existence of the Makefile in your program directory.
For those of you who need to edit the <kbd>submit</kbd> command line in the
Makefile: the Makefile syntax is somewhat picky, so if you run into
any problems at the very last minute, as a fall-back you can always
type in your <kbd>submit</kbd> command at the Unix shell.  But here's a hint
that should solve most problems: the Makefile requires a tab (not
spaces) at the start of all lines with Unix commands -- so don't
erase the tab that starts the line with the Unix <kbd>submit</kbd> command.
