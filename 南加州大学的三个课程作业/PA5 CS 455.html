CS 455 Programming Assignment 5</h2></center>

<div align="right">Fall 2016 [Bono]

<a name="intro"><h3>Introduction and Background</h3></a>

In this assignment you will use C++ linked lists to implement a data
structure we have studied in this class: a hash table.  The hash table
is in a class called <kbd>Table</kbd> (what you know as a map).  To
make it more interesting, we're going to test our class in two
different programs: one is a command-based test driver you will write
(a program to maintain student names and scores), and the other is a
C++ version of the concordance program we wrote in lab 10.  We wrote
the concordance program for you.
<p>

Note that there is a very short time-line on this assignment: there's
only about two weeks to complete it.  We recommend you start
immediately.  To help you complete the program successfully and on
time we have included some development hints and a suggested milestone
<a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/pa5.html#devel">later</a> in this document.

</p><p>
To be able to use a C++ class in multiple programs, but not end up
with multiple versions of our class code, these are going to be
multi-file programs that use separate compilation and a Makefile.  We
will be discussing these topics more in lecture soon.  However, we
wrote the Makefile for you, and put all the necessary include
statements in the source files so as to make this aspect of the
assignment as painless as possible for you.  <strong>Note: it will not
work to use the regular g++ command to compile this program.</strong>
There are more specifics about this in the <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/pa5.html#fileorg">File
Organization</a> section below.

</blockquote>



</li></ul>

<a name="fileorg"><h3>File organization and compiling multi-file programs in C++</h3>

Separately compiled programs in C++ usually have two files per class:
</a><ul><a name="fileorg">

</a><li><a name="fileorg"> The header file (suffix <kbd>.h</kbd>) contains the class
definition.  It also has some preprocessor directives (start with #).
We've already given you a partially completed header file,
</a><a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/Table.h"><kbd>Table.h</kbd></a>, for the Table class; this header file specifies
the class interface via the class definition and associated comments.
Any additions you need to make to the class definition go in this
file: in particular, you will need to add the private data and the
headers for any private methods here -- as with other classes we have
specified for you this semester, you are <em>not</em> allowed to make any
changes to the <kbd>public</kbd> section of this class definition.

</li><li> The implementation file (suffix <kbd>.cpp</kbd>) contains the
implementation of the methods.  That is, the complete method
definitions for all the methods, public and private.  This file needs
to <kbd>#include</kbd> the class header file (i.e.,
<kbd>Table.h</kbd>).  We started your <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/Table.cpp"><kbd>Table.cpp</kbd></a>, and put the necessary
#include in it.

</li></ul>

This program is also going to contain a second separately-compiled
module, although it's one that does not have a class in it.  It's going to
be a module with our <kbd>Node</kbd> struct and all the functions for
operating on a linked list of that node type .  This module is needed
for the chaining in your hash table.  That module will also have a
header file plus an implementation file.  It is described in more
detail in the section on <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/pa5.html#listfuncs">linked list
functions</a>.  Since this module is only used in the Table
<em>implementation</em> the #include statement for its header file is
only in <kbd>Table.cpp</kbd> (and <listfuncs.cpp< kbd="">).  In
particular Table.h does not depend on what is in the list module.
<p>

To make a complete program from the files that comprise the Table
class, plus the linked list module, we need another source code file
with <kbd>main</kbd> in it (suffix <kbd>.cpp </kbd>).  This file could
also have other helper functions used by main.  It needs to #include
the header file for any classes it uses.  For the grades program we
already put the necessary #include statement in <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/grades.cpp"><kbd>grades.cpp</kbd></a> for you.  See <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/concord.cpp"><kbd>concord.cpp</kbd></a> as an example of a
completed Table client program.
</p><p>

Although the file organization for this program may seem a little
confusing right now, we have already provided all the necessary
#include statements in the starter files, as well as a Makefile to
compile all the modules, so if you follow the assignment directions
about what to put where in your source code files and for how to
compile the program, you should have no problems.  (Famous last words
:-))


</p><h4>Compiling the program</h4>

For this assignment the <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/Makefile"><kbd>Makefile</kbd></a> we
wrote for you takes care of creating the necessary executables from
the various source code files.  The Makefile has comments that explain
how to use it for the various tasks it was made for.  Repeated here
is how you use it to compile your programs (the following are Unix
shell commands that will work when the Makefile is in the same
directory as your source code):

<p>

</p><dl>
<dt>
<strong><kbd>gmake grades</kbd></strong>
</dt>
<dd>
Makes the <kbd>grades</kbd> executable.
</dd>
<p>
</p><dt>
<strong><kbd>gmake concord</kbd></strong>
</dt>
<dd>
Makes the <kbd>concord</kbd> executable.
</dd>
<p>
</p><dt>
<strong><kbd>gmake pa5list</kbd></strong>
</dt>
<dd>
Makes the <kbd>pa5list</kbd> executable.(See <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/pa5.html#milestone">milestone</a> section for details.)
</dd>

<p>
</p></dl>

<p>
To clarify, you use one of the <kbd>gmake</kbd> commands above <em>instead</em> of using <kbd>g++</kbd>.  Note: The Makefile will also create some .o files in your directory,
which are compiled versions of the different program modules (roughly
analogous to Java .class files).

<a name="table"></a></p><h3><a name="table">The <kbd>Table</kbd> class</a></h3><a name="table">

<h4>Table interface</h4>
The Table class is similar in functionality to the Java Map class.  To
simplify your implementation, this one does not use C++ templates (=
Java generics), but is fixed to use a key type of <kbd>string</kbd>
and a value type of <kbd>int</kbd>.  Also to keep things simple, there
is no iterator interface: the only way to visit all the elements is
via the <kbd>printAll</kbd> function.
</a><p><a name="table">
The exact interface for the Table class is given in </a><a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/Table.h">Table.h</a>.  You are not allowed to change the
interface (i.e., public section) for this class.
</p><p>

<strong>The <kbd>concord</kbd> program: Example of using the Table class</strong>

We wrote a complete program that uses the <kbd>Table</kbd> class,
<kbd>concord.cpp</kbd>.  This is a concordance program like the one we
did in an earlier Java lecture and that we enhanced in one of our
labs, but that uses the Table class we're implementing here.  This
version filters words, but it does not sort the output.  We wrote this
whole program for you -- you will just need to complete your Table
class to be able to compile and run it successfully.
</p><p>

Please read the code in <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/concord.cpp">concord.cpp</a>, to see
examples of how to call the <kbd>Table</kbd> methods, and what they do.  In particular,
you can see that, since <kbd>lookup</kbd> returns a pointer to the
value that goes with the given key, we can use <kbd>lookup</kbd> not only to
access that value, but also to <em>update</em> the value.

</p><p>
<strong>Info about hashStats parameter</strong> The hashStats() method
is parameterized so you can use it to print out to different output
streams at different times.  One of these streams is <kbd>cout</kbd>
and another is <kbd>cerr</kbd> (more about cerr in the comments at the
top of <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/concord.cpp">concord.cpp</a>).  You
write the print statements in this function just as if you were
writing to cout, but you use the parameter instead.  Here's an
example of defining and calling a function with an <kbd>ostream</kbd> parameter:

</p><pre>// Param "out" is the output stream to write to.
// (passed by reference, because "&lt;&lt;" updates the stream object)
void testOut(ostream &amp;out) {
   out &lt;&lt; "Hello there!" &lt;&lt; endl;
}
. . .
// example calls:
   testOut(cout);
   testOut(cerr);
</pre>

You can see an example call to hashStats in the main function in 
in <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/concord.cpp">concord.cpp</a>.

<h4>Table implementation</h4>

<p>
You are required to implement your Table class using a hash table that
you implement.  This hash table will use chaining via linked lists.
For this assignment you may not use STL container classes or any other
classes or functions not implemented by you (a few exceptions: C++
<kbd>string</kbd>, the I/O library, and a hash function from the
library that is called in the starter code).
</p><p>
Since the key type is fixed for this hash table, we can fix what the
hash function is too.  We wrote the hash function for you.  It's
defined in the private section of the Table class.  
</p><p>
Note: to compare two C++ <kbd>string</kbd>s for equality, you use
<kbd>==</kbd>.  By the way, the other relational operators are also defined for
strings as well.
</p><p>
Unlike the Java HashMap, our hash table will be a fixed size once it
gets created.  There are two constructors for the Table class; one
that uses a constant in Table to determine the size, and another that
gets the size to use in a parameter.  The latter makes the class more
flexible; but we also included it to make it easy for you to test
your code on <em>very</em> small hash table sizes so you can force collisions to
occur.
</p><p>

<a name="dynarr"><strong>Dynamic arrays</strong>.
<br>
An implication of the client-specified hash size discussed in the
previous paragraph is that our representation has to involve a dynamic
array, rather than a fixed size array.  Remember that with a
fixed-size array in C++, the size is fixed at compile-time, so it's
impossible to use a value specified from the client/user.  Once we create the
dynamic array in our table, however, its size won't change.
</a></p><p><a name="dynarr">
Creating a dynamic array looks a lot like creating a Java array,
except we use a pointer type.  The pointer points to the first element
in the array.  However, once the array is created we can use normal [] syntax
to reference elements.
</a></p><p><a name="dynarr">
Here is some example code:
</a></p><pre><a name="dynarr">int * arr;         // var decl for a dynamic array of integers
arr = new int[10];     // create an array of 10 ints
          // (unlike in java, array elements are not automatically initialized)
arr[3] = 7;        // put a 7 in a[3]
cout &lt;&lt; arr[10];   // error: invalid array index (exact behavior undefined)
delete [] arr;     // reclaim memory for the array
         // (use [] form of delete with anything allocated with [] form of new)
</a></pre><a name="dynarr">

The syntax for declaring our array will be a little hairy, because the
element type itself will be a pointer.  Each element is going to be a
<kbd>Node*</kbd> for a linked list:

<pre>Node* * data;  // decl for array of pointers to Node (yes, need two *'s)
data = new Node*[100];    // allocate an array of 100 pointers to Node
data[0];        // this expression is type Node*
</pre>

This example should be helpful for you to get started with working
with this type in the Table class.  We have defined the
<kbd>ListType</kbd> typedef for you already to help abstract the list
part of things.  Here's the code we just saw using ListType instead:

<p>
</p><pre>typedef Node * ListType;
ListType * data;
data = new ListType[100];
data[0];         // this expression is type ListType (= Node*)
</pre>
</a><p><a name="dynarr">

</a><a name="listfuncs"></a>
<strong>Linked list 
functions.</strong> <br> One requirement for managing the complexity of
the Table class representation, and keeping different levels of
abstraction straight is to write linked list routines that take 
ListType as a parameter to do each of the necessary linked list
operations for dealing with a hash chain.  For example, one such
function might be:

</p><pre>bool listRemove(ListType &amp; list, string target);
</pre>

When your Table code calls listRemove, it would pass to it one element
of the hash table array (i.e., one chain, or one hash bucket).
<p>
You are required to define these functions as regular functions in <a name="listFuncs.cpp"> <kbd>listFuncs.cpp</kbd></a>, rather than trying to
make them part of the Table class.  
Because we are writing them as a separately compilable module, we will
also need to put their prototypes in <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/listFuncs.h"><kbd>listFuncs.h</kbd></a>.  Recall that we saw
examples of function prototypes in the <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/lectures/code/11-15/freq.cpp"><kbd>freq.cpp</kbd></a> example in
a recent lecture, although in that case they were not in a header
file, because that was a single-file program.  The advantage of a
separate module is it makes it easy to test them independently from
the Table class, and then later use them directly the Table class
implementation.  In a <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/pa5.html#devel">later section</a> we
discuss a plan for testing these functions independently.
</p><p>

<strong>Copy semantics and reclaiming memory</strong>.
<br>

The Table class contains dynamic data, so we need to be concerned
about how table objects get copied.  When we pass an object by value,
the formal parameter is initialized using something called the copy
constructor.  When we assign one object to another we use the
assignment (=) operator.  C++ supplies built-in versions of these two
methods; however, the built-in versions only do a shallow copy, so do
not work correctly for objects that contain dynamic data.  It's a
little bit tricky to define these correctly to do deep copy, so we are
going opt for something simpler here: we are going to
<em>disallow</em> copying our Table objects. We do this by making the
headers for those methods private.  We already put the code to
disallow copies in your <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/Table.h">Table.h</a> file; you do not
need to do anything else for this to work the way we want. Table
objects can still be used as parameters passed by reference or
const-reference, since that doesn't involve copying the object.
</p><p>
[One note for future reference: even if you create a class that
disallows copies, you normally would define another method, called a
destructor, that reclaims the dynamic memory when a client is done
with your object.  We won't have time to discuss that topic in detail, and
not having it won't really matter for the way we are using Tables in
our client programs here, so our Table class is not going to define a destructor.]
</p><p>
Note: you should still reclaim the Node memory no longer needed in
when you remove an entry from the Table.

<a name="grades"></a></p><h3><a name="grades"><kbd>grades</kbd> program</a></h3><a name="grades">
<p>

This is going to be a simple program to keep track of students and
their scores in a class.  It's not meant to be ultra-realistic (for
example, only one score per name, and no way to save scores), but it's really
a test driver for your <kbd>Table</kbd> implementation.
</p></a><p><a name="grades">
The program takes one optional command-line argument, the size for the
hash table -- if the argument is left off, the program uses the
default hash size.  We have already written the code to deal with the
command line argument (you can see the starter code </a><a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/grades.cpp">here</a>).  When the program starts up it creates a
hash table, immediately prints out the hashStats() for that empty
table, and then should print the initial command prompt ("cmd&gt; ").  In
the following example of program startup % is the Unix shell prompt
and user input is shown in italics

</p><pre>% <em>grades 7</em>
number of buckets: 7
number of entries: 0
number of non-empty buckets: 0
longest chain: 0
cmd&gt; 
</pre>
<p>
Once this start-up happens the program repeatedly reads and executes
commands from the user, printing out the command prompt (<kbd>cmd&gt;</kbd>) after it finishes
the previous command, until the user enters the quit command.
</p><p>
Here are the commands for the program (in the following a name will
always be a single word):
</p><p>
</p><dl>

<dt> <kbd>insert <em>name score</em> </kbd>
</dt><dd>
Insert this name and score in the grade table.  If this name was
already present, print a message to that effect, and don't do the
insert.
<p>
</p></dd><dt> <kbd>change <em>name newscore</em></kbd>
</dt><dd>
Change the score for name.
Print an appropriate message if this name isn't present.
<p>
</p></dd><dt> <kbd>lookup <em>name</em></kbd>
</dt><dd>
Lookup the name, and print out his or her score, or a message indicating that student is not in the table.
<p>
</p></dd><dt> <kbd>remove <em>name</em></kbd>
</dt><dd>
Remove this student.  If this student wasn't in the grade table, print
a message to that effect.
<p>
</p></dd><dt> <kbd>print</kbd>
</dt><dd>
Prints out all names and scores in the table.
<p>
</p></dd><dt> <kbd>size</kbd>
</dt><dd>
Prints out the number of entries in the table.
<p>
</p></dd><dt> <kbd>stats</kbd>
</dt><dd>
Prints out statistics about the hash table at this point. (Calls
hashStats() method)
<p>
</p></dd><dt> <kbd>help</kbd>
</dt><dd>
Prints out a brief command summary.
<p>
</p></dd><dt> <kbd>quit</kbd>

</dt><dd>
Exits the program.
</dd></dl>
<p>

The only error-checking required for this program is for you to print
out "ERROR: invalid command", and the command summary (see 'help'
command) if a user give an invalid command name.  Once you print the
message your program should then display another command prompt.
</p><p>
So, for example, you do not have to check whether the user has entered
the correct number of arguments or the correct type of arguments for
a command (i.e., the graders will not test your program on those
conditions).
</p><p>

Note: this program enables you to test all of the table methods.

<a name="concordtest"></a></p><h3><a name="concordtest">Using the <kbd>concord</kbd> program to test <kbd>Table</kbd></a></h3><a name="concordtest">

Once you are convinced your Table class works with the other test program,
you should use <kbd>concord.cpp</kbd> program along with the <kbd>.txt</kbd> files that
came with the assignment to test your Table class with a larger amount
of data.  This program does not use all of the Table methods, so is
not suitable as a complete test of your Table class.  See comments in
</a><a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/concord.cpp">concord.cpp</a> for how to run it.

</a>

Here's a suggested development plan to help you succeed on this assignment:

<ol> 

<li> Think through what exact operations you will need on a single
chain to implement the various Table methods.  Define the exact
interface of functions to do these operations on a single linked list.
These kinds of operations were discussed <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/pa5.html#listfuncs">here</a>.

<p>
</p></li><li>

By next Thurs or Friday (11/24 or 11/25) have all of your linked list
routines written and tested (if it weren't a holiday, this milestone
would have been next week's lab). Because they don't depend on the
private data of the hash table class (just the Node class) you can
write a separate program to test these thoroughly, before you tackle
any of code dealing with a dynamic array, etc. See <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/pa5.html#milestone">the next section</a> for more details about this
milestone.
<p>

</p></li><li> Once you are convinced that your list code works, you can start working
on the <kbd>Table</kbd> class that uses these functions.
Implement the constructors, <kbd>insert</kbd> and
<kbd>printAll</kbd> methods of <kbd>Table</kbd>, and test them with a partially written
<kbd>grades.cpp</kbd>.
<p>

</p></li><li> Add other <kbd>Table</kbd> methods and the corresponding
<kbd>grades.cpp</kbd> code that tests those methods to your program,
one at a time, testing them as you go, until you have a completely
working grades program.
<p>

</p></li><li> Test your <kbd>Table</kbd> class with <kbd>concord.cpp</kbd>
running on the two story files given.

<a name="milestone"><h3>Milestone</h3>

For each of the operations on the </a><a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/Table.h"><kbd>Table</kbd> class</a>, figure out
what corresponding operations you will need on a single chain to help
complete the operation.  You will need pretty much one chain (i.e.,
linked list) operation per Table operation: there may be one or two
situations where you can reuse an operation in multiple places.
<p>

Note: besides the stuff mentioned in the previous paragraph, this milestone
is about code that operates on a single linked list, not about hash tables.
Put another way, it doesn't involve the Table class, but it involves
building functions that operate on ListType (a.k.a., Node*).  These
functions will be useful tools that will make implementing the table
class easier.
</p><p>

To complete this milestone, you are going to write a test-program called <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/pa5list.cpp"><kbd>pa5list.cpp</kbd></a> that will contain code to test
all of your linked list functions.  The linked list functions
themselves will be in the file <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/listFuncs.cpp"><kbd>listFuncs.cpp</kbd></a>, and the prototypes
for those functions (as well as the <kbd>Node</kbd> definition) will
be in <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/listFuncs.h"><kbd>listFuncs.h</kbd></a> We provided starter
versions for all three of these files.
</p><p>
The <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/Makefile"><kbd>Makefile</kbd></a> for this assignment
already contains a rule to create the executable <kbd>pa5list</kbd>
from these files.  (I.e., do the unix command "gmake pa5list" to compile it.)
</p><p>

These functions you create to operate on a linked list will be regular
functions (not methods) that pass data in and out via explicit
parameters and return values (like the linked list functions we have
written in lecture and in last week's lab).  Each of them involves a
parameter of type <kbd>ListType</kbd> passed by value or by reference.
This was discussed further, with an example header give in the section
of the assignment on <a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/pa5.html#listfuncs">linked list functions</a>.
As mentioned there, once you have thoroughly tested them, 
you will be able to use them in your code for the <kbd>Table</kbd> class.
</p><p>
The design of your test driver (pa5list.cpp) is up to you.  We
recommend you write it so it works on hard-coded data, as we have done
for other unit tests we have written for this course.  
</p><p>
Note: you are
not required to submit <kbd>pa5list.cpp</kbd> as part of pa5.  You
<em>are</em>, however, required to put all of your linked list code
for the assignment in <kbd>listFuncs.h</kbd> and
<kbd>listFuncs.cpp


<a name="style"></a></kbd></p><h3><a name="style">Grading criteria</a></h3><a name="style">

This program will be graded approximately 70% on correctness, 30% on
style and documentation (where the list module requirement is part of
that style score).  As usual we will be using the </a><a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/style.html">style guidelines</a> published for the class.
<p>


<a name="submit"></a></p><h3><a name="submit">README file / Submitting your program</a></h3><a name="submit">
</a><p><a name="submit">
Your <kbd>README</kbd> file must document known bugs in your program,
contain the signed </a><a href="http://scf.usc.edu/~csci455/curr/assgts/pa5/pa5.html#certification">certification</a> shown
near the top of this document, and contain any special instructions or
